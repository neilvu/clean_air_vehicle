# Washington State Clean Air Vehicle Requirements Database (INST327)

Purpose: To understand whether clean air vehicles benefits the state's goals to a cleaner air (based on different types of fuels like clean air to battery) as well with tax-exempt incentives for those who qualify based on the clean air requirements. These would definitely improve the stake owners from businesses and government relationships when it comes to initializing this environmental program.

Objectives:

a). Created a series of wide variety of data tables to analyze the trends of this base (original) table by finding the attributes of the columns and where they need to be assigned to the following child tables.

b). Abstracted data from the original database to create and make queries in alignment with the project questions as well with our interest in learning more about the clean air requirements database for vehicles. These includes which kind of brands and models, to the type of fuels and the year, and whether if that particular vehicle would be suited for the state of Washington's clean air requirement program. 

Tax-exempt information can be available in this link here:

c). Demonstrate programming knowledge and abilities by working with teams hands-on to develop and execute the following project database and the queries attached.

NOTE: We set this at a max of 100 rows in the original table because of the redundancy of the tables that were duplicated in the same areas but in years combined as well with those who are new to programming who needed more time to understand how the queries worked out. As a leader of this project, I not only coordinate for teen project, but also worked and listen to the team's concerns in terms of the progress and how to address based on what we need to complete for the project terms.
